# Final Project Proposal
## Photon Mapping
Shuyang Zhang & Yaran Yang


In the final project for CSE 168, we plan to do a photon mapping to achieve redering under water. Photon Mappung is a global illumination technique that could render some scene with Caustic Phenomenon, for example, the light streak on the bottom of the water.
